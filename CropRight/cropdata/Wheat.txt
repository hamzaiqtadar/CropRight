-For wheat, the minimum daily temperature for measurable growth is about 5°C. Mean daily temperature for optimum growth and tillering is between 15° and 25°C.A dry, warm ripening period of 18°C or more is preferred.

-The length of the total growing period of wheat ranges from 120 to 150 days.

-For high yields water requirements are 300 to 600 mm depending on climate and length of  growing period.

-If rainfall is insufficient, irrigation will be required.

In addition to pre-irrigation, the crop will require: 

One irrigation during early vegetative period; 

Or two  irrigations - one during early vegetative period and one just prior to head emergence  through flowering period; 

Or three irrigations - during  early vegetative period, just  prior to head development through flowering period and early yield formation  period; 

Or four irrigations - during early vegetative, late vegetative, flowering and  early yield  formation periods.
