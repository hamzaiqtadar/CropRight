-For germination the lowest mean daily temperature is about 10°C, with 18 to 20°C being optimum. 

-Maize can tolerates hot and dry atmospheric conditions so long as sufficient water is available to the plant and temperatures are below 45°C.

-For maximum production a medium maturity grain crop requires between 400 and 800 mm of water depending on climate.

-Under conditions of marginal rainfall and limited irrigation water supply, the number of possible irrigation applications may vary between 2 and 5.
